Knowledge Reasoning and Representation

Knowledge representation and reasoning -KRÂ², KR&R is the field of artificial intelligence (AI) dedicated to representing information about the world in a form that a computer system can utilize to solve complex tasks such as diagnosing a medical condition or having a dialog in a natural language. 

Knowledge representation incorporates findings from psychology about how humans solve problems and represent knowledge in order to design formalisms that will make complex systems easier to design and build.

Knowledge representation and reasoning also incorporates findings from logic to automate various kinds of reasoning, such as the application of rules or the relations of sets and subsets.

Examples of knowledge representation formalisms include :

   semantic nets
   systems architecture
   frames
   rules
   ontologies.

Examples of automated reasoning engines include inference engines, theorem provers, and classifiers.

Semantic networks were one of the first knowledge representation primitives. 

Also, data structures and algorithms for general fast search. 

In early systems, the Lisp programming language, which was modeled after the lambda calculus, was often used as a form of functional knowledge representation.

Frames and Rules were the next kind of primitive. Frame languages had various mechanisms for expressing and enforcing constraints on frame data. All data in frames are stored in slots. Slots are analogous to relations in entity-relation modeling and to object properties in object-oriented modeling. 

Another technique for primitives is to define languages that are modeled after First Order Logic (FOL). The most well known example is Prolog, but there are also many special purpose theorem proving environments. These environments can validate logical models and can deduce new theories from existing models. 

Semantic Network

A semantic network, or frame network is a knowledge base that represents semantic relations between concepts in a network. 
This is often used as a form of knowledge representation.

It is a directed or undirected graph consisting of vertices, which represent concepts, and edges, which represent semantic relations between concepts, mapping or connecting semantic fields.
